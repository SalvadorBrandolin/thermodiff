# thermodiff

This package provides simple SymPy shenanigans and shortcuts for thermodynamic
expressions differentiation and manipulation.

The project is designed for personal use and personal preferences. By now, this
package is kind of a toy-simple tool. Therefore, super-complex features are not
probably going to be implemented. However, if you have a simple feature that
you think is useful, please open an issue in the repository.

## Installation
```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/SalvadorBrandolin/thermodiff
```

## Tutorial
You can find the tutorial here:


There I use the package to obtain the derivatives of the Excess Gibbs free
energy model UNIQUAC. I think it is a good example of how to use the package.
If you discover a situation that is not handled by the package or the tutorial,
please open an issue in the repository.
